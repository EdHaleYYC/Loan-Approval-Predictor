# Loan-Approval-Predictor
Automated loan eligibility process using application data submitted online

Used a Naive Bayes model to review applicant data to either approve or not approve a loan. To do this I followed these steps:

Data Preparation
Feature Engineering
Supervised Learning
Pipelines
Model Persistance
Flask - building an API
Deployment to Cloud (AWS)

Project could be improved by created a UI for applicants to input application data rather than creating a dictionary in python

Main packages: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, sklearn, pickle
